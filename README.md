Shipment pricing system are new generation of traditional shipment pricing where the whole process right from tracking the shipment package till delivery of the package to the customer. Users are able to track and find the cost of their package to be shipped by any modes. Apart from interesting real-world applications of Shipment pricing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Our main aim to predict reliable model which would be used across the all situation for predicting accurate prices
